On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least\nso as to distinguish one figure from another.

As\nsoon as you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will\nfind that it ceases to appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes\nin appearance a straight line. Take for example an equilateral\nTriangle—who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class.\nFigure 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were\nbending over him from above; figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman,\nas you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on\nthe level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the\ntable (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing\nbut a straight line.",

The far-off land may have bays,\nforelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a\ndistance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright\nupon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light\nand shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.",
      "Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other\nacquaintances comes towards us in Flatland. As there is neither sun\nwith us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none\nof the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland. If our friend\ncomes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it\nbecomes smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a\nTriangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will—a straight\nLine he looks and nothing else.",

      "As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass\nNorth, South, East, and West.",
      "There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us\nto determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our\nown. By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the\nSouth; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight—so that\neven a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs\nnorthward without much difficulty—yet the hampering effort of the\nsouthward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most\nparts of our earth. Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated\nintervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance;\nand in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course\nhave their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so\nthat the roofs may keep off the rain from the North. In the country,\nwhere there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some sort\nof guide. Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be\nexpected in determining our bearings.",
      "Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is\nhardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where\nthere have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been\noccasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting\ntill the rain came before continuing my journey. On the weak and aged,\nand especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much\nmore heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point\nof breeding, if you meet a Lady on the street, always to give her the\nNorth side of the way—by no means an easy thing to do always at short\nnotice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is\ndifficult to tell your North from your South.",
      "Windows there are none in our houses: for the light comes to us alike\nin our homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times\nand in all places, whence we know not. It was in old days, with our\nlearned men, an interesting and oft-investigate question, “What is the\norigin of light?” and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted,\nwith no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the\nwould-be solvers. Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such\ninvestigations indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the\nLegislature, in comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.\nI—alas, I alone in Flatland—know now only too well the true solution of\nthis mysterious problem; but my knowledge cannot be made intelligible\nto a single one of my countrymen; and I am mocked at—I, the sole\npossessor of the truths of Space and of the theory of the introduction\nof Light from the world of three Dimensions—as if I were the maddest of\nthe mad! But a truce to these painful digressions: let me return to our\nhomes.",
      "The most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or\npentagonal, as in the annexed figure. The two Northern sides _RO_,\n_OF_, constitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the\nEast is a small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for\nthe Men; the South side or floor is usually doorless.",
      "[Illustration]",
      "Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason. The\nangles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,)\nbeing much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of\ninanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men\nand Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of\na square or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an\ninconsiderate or perhaps absentminded traveller suddenly running\nagainst them: and therefore, as early as the eleventh century of our\nera, triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only\nexceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other\nstate buildings, which is not desirable that the general public should\napproach without circumspection.",
      "At this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted, though\ndiscouraged by a special tax. But, about three centuries afterwards,\nthe Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten\nthousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that\ncould be allowed consistently with the public safety. The good sense of\nthe community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now,\neven in the country, the pentagonal construction has superseded every\nother. It is only now and then in some very remote and backward\nagricultural district that an antiquarian may still discover a square\nhouse.",
      "§ 3 Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland",
      "The greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant of Flatland\nmay be estimated at about eleven of your inches. Twelve inches may be\nregarded as a maximum.",
      "Our Women are Straight Lines.",
      "Our Soldiers and Lowest Class of Workmen are Triangles with two equal\nsides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so short\n(often not exceeding half an inch) that they form at their vertices a\nvery sharp and formidable angle. Indeed when their bases are of the\nmost degraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size),\nthey can hardly be distinguished from Straight lines or Women; so\nextremely pointed are their vertices. With us, as with you, these\nTriangles are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and\nby this name I shall refer to them in the following pages.",
      "Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.",
      "Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself\nbelong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.",
      "Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,\nbeginning at Six-Sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in\nthe number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of\nPolygonal, or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes\nso numerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot\nbe distinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or\nPriestly order; and this is the highest class of all.",
      "It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more\nside than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule)\none step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a\nSquare is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.",
      "But this rule applies not always to the Tradesman, and still less often\nto the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to\ndeserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides\nequal. With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the son\nof an Isosceles (_i.e._ a Triangle with two sides equal) remains\nIsosceles still. Nevertheless, all hope is not such out, even from the\nIsosceles, that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded\ncondition. For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent\nand skillful labours, it is generally found that the more intelligent\namong the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of\ntheir third side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides.\nIntermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons and daughters\nof these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally\nresult in an offspring approximating still more to the type of the\nEqual-Sided Triangle."

      "[1] “What need of a certificate?” a Spaceland critic may ask: “Is not\n the procreation of a Square Son a certificate from Nature herself,\n proving the Equal-sidedness of the Father?” I reply that no Lady of\n any position will mary an uncertified Triangle. Square offspring has\n sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle; but in almost\n every such case the Irregularity of the first generation is visited on\n the third; which either fails to attain the Pentagonal rank, or\n relapses to the Triangular."

      "The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the\nsubject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs round. After a\nstrict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the\ninfant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted\ninto the class of Equilaterals. He is then immediately taken from his\nproud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral,\nwho is bound by oath never to permit the child henceforth to enter his\nformer home or so much as to look upon his relations again, for fear\nlest the freshly developed organism may, by force of unconscious\nimitation, fall back again into his hereditary level.",
      "The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks of his\nserf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by the poor serfs themselves,\nas a gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their\nexistence, but also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher\nclasses are well aware that these rare phenomena, while they do little\nor nothing to vulgarize their own privileges, serve as almost useful\nbarrier against revolution from below.",
      "Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely\ndestitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in\nsome of their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their\nsuperior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the\nCircles. But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that in proportion\nas the working-classes increase in intelligence, knowledge, and all\nvirtue, in that same proportion their acute angle (which makes them\nphysically terrible) shall increase also and approximate to their\ncomparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle. Thus, in the\nmost brutal and formidable off the soldier class—creatures almost on a\nlevel with women in their lack of intelligence—it is found that, as\nthey wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous\npenetrating power to advantage, so do they wane in the power of\npenetration itself.",
      "How admirable is the Law of Compensation! And how perfect a proof of\nthe natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the\naristocratic constitution of the States of Flatland! By a judicious use\nof this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always able\nto stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the\nirrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind. Art also\ncomes to the aid of Law and Order. It is generally found possible—by a\nlittle artificial compression or expansion on the part of the State\nphysicians—to make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion\nperfectly Regular, and to admit them at once into the privileged\nclasses; a much larger number, who are still below the standard,\nallured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled, are induced to\nenter the State Hospitals, where they are kept in honourable\nconfinement for life; one or two alone of the most obstinate, foolish,\nand hopelessly irregular are led to execution."

Add to this the power of making\nherself practically invisible at will, and you will perceive that a\nFemale, in Flatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled with.",

When her\nside is turned towards us, we see her as a straight line; when the end\ncontaining her eye or mouth—for with us these two organs are\nidentical—is the part that meets our eye, then we see nothing but a\nhighly lustrous point; but when the back is presented to our view,\nthen—being only sub-lustrous, and, indeed, almost as dim as an\ninanimate object—her hinder extremity serves her as a kind of Invisible\nCap."

      "In some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females,\nunder penalty of death, from walking or standing in any public place\nwithout moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to\nindicate their presence to those behind them; others oblige a Woman,\nwhen travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by\nher husband; others confine Women altogether in their houses except\nduring the religious festivals.

The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated\nundulation of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and\nimitated by the wife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing\nbeyond a mere monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum; and the\nregular tick of the Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the\nwife of the progressive and aspiring Isosceles, in the females of whose\nfamily no “back-motion” of any kind has become as yet a necessity of\nlife. Hence, in every family of position and consideration, “back\nmotion” is as prevalent as time itself; and the husbands and sons in\nthese households enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.",

For as they have\nno pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this respect to the very\nlowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently wholly devoid of\nbrainpower, and have neither reflection, judgment nor forethought, and\nhardly any memory. Hence, in their fits of fury, they remember no\nclaims and recognize no distinctions.

In every Circular or Polygonal\nhousehold it has been a habit from time immemorial—and now has become a\nkind of instinct among the women of our higher classes—that the mothers\nand daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths towards\ntheir husband and his male friends; and for a lady in a family of\ndistinction to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a\nkind of portent, involving loss of _status_.

      "You, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you, who are gifted\nwith two eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective, and charmed\nwith the enjoyment of various colours, you, who can actually _see_ an\nangle, and contemplate the complete circumference of a Circle in the\nhappy region of the Three Dimensions—how shall I make it clear to you\nthe extreme difficulty which we in Flatland experience in recognizing\none another’s configuration?",
      "Recall what I told you above. All beings in Flatland, animate and\ninanimate, no matter what their form, present _to our view_ the same,\nor nearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line. How then\ncan one be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?",
      "The answer is threefold. The first means of recognition is the sense of\nhearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you, and\nwhich enables us not only to distinguish by the voice of our personal\nfriends, but even to discriminate between different classes, at least\nso far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral, the\nSquare, and the Pentagon—for the Isosceles I take no account. But as we\nascend the social scale, the process of discriminating and being\ndiscriminated by hearing increases in difficulty, partly because voices\nare assimilated, partly because the faculty of voice-discrimination is\na plebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy. And\nwherever there is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this\nmethod. Amongst our lowest orders, the vocal organs are developed to a\ndegree more than correspondent with those of hearing, so that an\nIsosceles can easily feign the voice of a Polygon, and, with some\ntraining, that of a Circle himself. A second method is therefore more\ncommonly resorted to.",
      "_Feeling_ is, among our Women and lower classes—about our upper classes\nI shall speak presently—the principal test of recognition, at all\nevents between strangers, and when the question is, not as to the\nindividual, but as to the class. What therefore “introduction” is among\nthe higher classes in Spaceland, that the process of “feeling” is with\nus. “Permit me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr.\nSo-and-so”—is still, among the more old-fashioned of our country\ngentlemen in districts remote from towns, the customary formula for a\nFlatland introduction. But in the towns, and among men of business, the\nwords “be felt by” are omitted and the sentence is abbreviated to, “Let\nme ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so”; although it is assumed, of course,\nthat the “feeling” is to be reciprocal. Among our still more modern and\ndashing young gentlemen—who are extremely averse to superfluous effort\nand supremely indifferent to the purity of their native language—the\nformula is still further curtailed by the use of “to feel” in a\ntechnical sense, meaning, “to\nrecommend-for-the-purposes-of-feeling-and-being-felt”; and at this\nmoment the “slang” of polite or fast society in the upper classes\nsanctions such a barbarism as “Mr. Smith, permit me to feel Mr. Jones.”"

      "Let not my Reader however suppose that “feeling” is with us the tedious\nprocess that it would be with you, or that we find it necessary to feel\nright round all the sides of every individual before we determine the\nclass to which he belongs. Long practice and training, begun in the\nschools and continued in the experience of daily life, enable us to\ndiscriminate at once by the sense of touch, between the angles of an\nequal-sided Triangle, Square, and Pentagon; and I need not say that the\nbrainless vertex of an acute-angled Isosceles is obvious to the dullest\ntouch. It is therefore not necessary, as a rule, to do more than feel a\nsingle angle of an individual; and this, once ascertained, tells us the\nclass of the person whom we are addressing, unless indeed he belongs to\nthe higher sections of the nobility. There the difficulty is much\ngreater. Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge has been\nknown to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided Polygon; and there is\nhardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University who\ncould pretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a\ntwenty-sided and a twenty-four sided member of the Aristocracy."

It is essential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt\nshould stand perfectly still. A start, a fidgety shifting of the\nposition, yes, even a violent sneeze, has been known before now to\nprove fatal to the incautious, and to nip in the bud many a promising\nfriendship. Especially is this true among the lower classes of the\nTriangles. With them, the eye is situated so far from their vertex that\nthey can scarcely take cognizance of what goes on at that extremity of\ntheir frame. They are, moreover, of a rough coarse nature, not\nsensitive to the delicate touch of the highly organized Polygon.

According to his account, my\nunfortunately Ancestor, being afflicted with rheumatism, and in the act\nof being felt by a Polygon, by one sudden start accidentally transfixed\nthe Great Man through the diagonal and thereby, partly in consequence\nof his long imprisonment and degradation, and partly because of the\nmoral shock which pervaded the whole of my Ancestor’s relations, threw\nback our family a degree and a half in their ascent towards better\nthings. The result was that in the next generation the family brain was\nregistered at only 58°, and not till the lapse of five generations was\nthe lost ground recovered, the full 60° attained, and the Ascent from\nthe Isosceles finally achieved.

      "I answer that though we cannot _see_ angles, we can _infer_ them, and\nthis with great precision. Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity,\nand developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles far\nmore accurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule or\nmeasure of angles. Nor must I omit to explain that we have great\nnatural helps. It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the\nIsosceles class shall begin at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and\nshall increase (if it increases at all) by half a degree in every\ngeneration until the goal of 60° is reached, when the condition of\nserfdom is quitted, and the freeman enters the class of Regulars."

The convenience as well as the beauty of the\nresults commended themselves to all. Wherever Chromatistes,—for by that\nname the most trustworthy authorities concur in calling him,—turned his\nvariegated frame, there he at once excited attention, and attracted\nrespect. No one now needed to “feel” him; no one mistook his front for\nhis back; all his movements were readily ascertained by his neighbours\nwithout the slightest strain on their powers of calculation; no one\njostled him, or failed to make way for him; his voice was saved the\nlabour of that exhausting utterance by which we colourless Squares and\nPentagons are often forced to proclaim our individuality when we move\namid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles."

This habit of abstention from\nFeeling in the best society enables a Circle the more easily to sustain\nthe veil of mystery in which, from his earliest years, he is wont to\nenwrap the exact nature of his Perimeter or Circumference. Three feet\nbeing the average Perimeter it follows that, in a Polygon of three\nhundred sides each side will be no more than the hundredth part of a\nfoot in length, or little more than the tenth part of an inch; and in a\nPolygon of six or seven hundred sides the sides are little larger than\nthe diameter of a Spaceland pin-head.

      "“I am no Woman,” replied the small Line: “I am the Monarch of the\nworld. But thou, whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland?”\nReceiving this abrupt reply, I begged pardon if I had in any way\nstartled or molested his Royal Highness; and describing myself as a\nstranger I besought the King to give me some account of his dominions.\nBut I had the greatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information\non points that really interested me; for the Monarch could not refrain\nfrom constantly assuming that whatever was familiar to him must also be\nknown to me and that I was simulating ignorance in jest.

Outside his World, or\nLine, all was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank\nimplies Space; say, rather, all was non-existent.",

I for my part noticed by the\nsense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some of your people\nare lines and others Points; and that some of the lines are larger—”\n“You speak of an impossibility,” interrupted the King; “you must have\nseen a vision; for to detect the difference between a Line and a Point\nby the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the nature of things,\nimpossible; but it can be detected by the sense of hearing, and by the\nsame means my shape can be exactly ascertained. Behold me—I am a Line,\nthe longest in Lineland, over six inches of Space—” “Of Length,” I\nventured to suggest. “Fool,” said he, “Space is Length. Interrupt me\nagain, and I have done.”",

Listen, I call to them.”",
      "He chirruped, and then complacently continued: “My wives at this moment\nreceiving the sound of one of my voice, closely followed by the other,\nand perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in which\nsound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is 6.457\ninches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my shape\nto be 6.457 inches. But you will of course understand that my wives do\nnot make this calculation every time they hear my two voices. They made\nit, once for all, before we were married. But they _could_ make it at\nany time. And in the same way I can estimate the shape of any of my\nMale subjects by the sense of sound.”",
      "“But how,” said I, “if a Man feigns a Woman’s voice with one of his two\nvoices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognized\nas the echo of the Northern? May not such deceptions cause great\ninconvenience? And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind by\ncommanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?” This of\ncourse was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered\nthe purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I\nsucceeded perfectly.",
      "“What!” cried he in horror, “explain your meaning.” “Feel, touch, come\ninto contact,” I replied. “If you mean by _feeling_,” said the King,\n“approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals,\nknow, Stranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by\ndeath. And the reason is obvious. The frail form of a Woman, being\nliable to be shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by\nthe State; but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of\nsight from Men, the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman\nshall be approached so closely as to destroy the interval between the\napproximator and the approximated.",

As to your suggested\ndanger of deception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the\nessence of one’s Being, cannot be thus changed at will.

Permit me but to descend at this moment and enlighten them.” “Not\nyet,” said my Guide, “the time will come for that. Meantime I must\nperform my mission. Stay thou there in thy place.” Saying these words,\nhe leaped with great dexterity into the sea (if I may so call it) of\nFlatland, right in the midst of the ring of Counsellors. “I come,” said\nhe, “to proclaim that there is a land of Three Dimensions.”",

      "That is the hope of my brighter moments. Alas, it is not always so.\nHeavily weights on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot\nhonestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen,\noft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept,\n“Upward, not Northward,” haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx. It is\npart of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of Truth that there\nare seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres flit away into\nthe background of scarce-possible existences; when the Land of Three\nDimensions seems almost as visionary as the Land of One or None; nay,\nwhen even this hard wall that bars me from my freedom, these very\ntablets on which I am writing, and all the substantial realities of\nFlatland itself, appear no better than the offspring of a diseased\nimagination, or the baseless fabric of a dream.",

      "PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND REVISED EDITION, 1884. BY THE EDITOR",
      "If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed\nwhen he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to\nrepresent him in this preface, in which he desires, fully, to return\nhis thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland, whose appreciation\nhas, with unexpected celerity, required a second edition of this work;\nsecondly, to apologize for certain errors and misprints (for which,\nhowever, he is not entirely responsible); and, thirdly, to explain one\nor two misconceptions. But he is not the Square he once was. Years of\nimprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general incredulity and\nmockery, have combined with the thoughts and notions, and much also of\nthe terminology, which he acquired during his short stay in spaceland.\nHe has, therefore, requested me to reply in his behalf to two special\nobjections, one of an intellectual, the other of a moral nature.",
      "The first objection is, that a Flatlander, seeing a Line, sees\nsomething that must be _thick_ to the eye as well as _long_ to the eye\n(otherwise it would not be visible, if it had not some thickness); and\nconsequently he ought (it is argued) to acknowledge that his countrymen\nare not only long and broad, but also (though doubtless to a very\nslight degree) _thick_ or _high_. This objection is plausible, and, to\nSpacelanders, almost irresistible, so that, I confess, when I first\nheard it, I knew not what to reply. But my poor old friend’s answer\nappears to me completely to meet it.",
      "“I admit,” said he—when I mentioned to him this objection—“I admit the\ntruth of your critic’s facts, but I deny his conclusions. It is true\nthat we have really in Flatland a Third unrecognized Dimension called\n‘height,’ just as it also is true that you have really in Spaceland a\nFourth unrecognized Dimension, called by no name at present, but which\nI will call ‘extra-height.’ But we can no more take cognizance of our\n‘height’ than you can of your ‘extra-height.’ Even I—who have been in\nSpaceland, and have had the privilege of understanding for twenty-four\nhours the meaning of ‘height’—even I cannot now comprehend it, nor\nrealize it by the sense of sight or by any process of reason; I can but\napprehend it by faith.",
      "“The reason is obvious. Dimension implies direction, implies\nmeasurement, implies the more and the less. Now, all our lines are\n_equally_ and _infinitesimally_ thick (or high, whichever you like);\nconsequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the\nconception of that Dimension. No ‘delicate micrometer’—as has been\nsuggested by one too hasty Spaceland critic—would in the least avail\nus; for we should not know _what to measure, nor in what direction_.\nWhen we see a Line, we see something that is long and _bright;\nbrightness_, as well as length, is necessary to the existence of a\nLine; if the brightness vanishes, the Line is extinguished. Hence, all\nmy Flatland friends—when I talk to them about the unrecognized\nDimension which is somehow visible in a Line—say, ‘Ah, you mean\n_brightness_’: and when I reply, ‘No, I mean a real Dimension,’ they at\nonce retort, ‘Then measure it, or tell us in what direction it\nextends’; and this silences me, for I can do neither. Only yesterday,\nwhen the Chief Circle (in other words our High Priest) came to inspect\nthe State Prison and paid me his seventh annual visit, and when for the\nseventh time he put me the question, ‘Was I any better?’ I tried to\nprove to him that he was ‘high,’ as well as long and broad, although he\ndid not know it. But what was his reply? ‘You say I am “high”; measure\nmy “high-ness” and I will believe you.’ What could I do? How could I\nmeet his challenge? I was crushed; and he left the room triumphant."

      "“Does this still seem strange to you? Then put yourself in a similar\nposition. Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension, condescending to\nvisit you, were to say, ‘Whenever you open your eyes, you see a Plane\n(which is of Two Dimensions) and you _infer_ a Solid (which is of\nThree); but in reality you also see (though you do not recognize) a\nFourth Dimension, which is not colour nor brightness nor anything of\nthe kind, but a true Dimension, although I cannot point out to you its\ndirection, nor can you possibly measure it.’ What would you say to such\na visitor? Would not you have him locked up? Well, that is my fate: and\nit is as natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for preaching\nthe Third Dimension, as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube\nfor preaching the Fourth. Alas, how strong a family likeness runs\nthrough blind and persecuting humanity in all Dimensions! Points,\nLines, Squares, Cubes, Extra-Cubes—we are all liable to the same\nerrors, all alike the Slaves of our respective Dimensional prejudices,\nas one of our Spaceland poets has said—",

      "[1] The Author desires me to add, that the misconceptions of some of\n his critics on this matter has induced him to insert (on pp. 74 and\n 92) in his dialogue with the Sphere, certain remarks which have a\n bearing on the point in question and which he had previously omitted\n as being tedious and unnecessary.",
      "On this point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable.\nI wish I could say that his answer to the second (or moral) objection\nwas equally clear and cogent. It has been objected that he is a\nwoman-hater; and as this objection has been vehemently urged by those\nwhom Nature’s decree has constituted the somewhat larger half of the\nSpaceland race, I should like to remove it, so far as I can honestly do\nso. But the Square is so unaccustomed to the use of the moral\nterminology of Spaceland that I should be doing him an injustice if I\nwere literally to transcribe his defence against this charge. Acting,\ntherefore, as his interpreter and summarizer, I gather that in the\ncourse of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modified his\nown personal views, both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles\nor Lower Classes. Personally, he now inclines to the opinion of the\nSphere (see page 86) that the Straight Lines are in many important\nrespects superior to the Circles. But, writing as a Historian, he has\nidentified himself (perhaps too closely) with the views generally\nadopted by Flatland, and (as he has been informed) even by Spaceland,\nHistorians; in whose pages (until very recent times) the destinies of\nWomen and of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of\nmention and never of careful consideration."

      "In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow the Circular\nor aristocratic tendencies with which some critics have naturally\ncredited him. While doing justice to the intellectual power with which\na few Circles have for many generations maintained their supremacy over\nimmense multitudes of their countrymen, he believes that the facts of\nFlatland, speaking for themselves without comment on his part, declare\nthat Revolutions cannot always be suppressed by slaughter, and that\nNature, in sentencing the Circles to infecundity, has condemned them to\nultimate failure—“and herein,” he says, “I see a fulfilment of the\ngreat Law of all worlds, that while the wisdom of Man thinks it is\nworking one thing, the wisdom of Nature constrains it to work another,\nand quite a different and far better thing.” For the rest, he begs his\nreaders not to suppose that every minute detail in the daily life of\nFlatland must needs correspond to some other detail in Spaceland; and\nyet he hopes that, taken as a whole, his work may prove suggestive as\nwell as amusing, to those Spacelanders of moderate and modest minds\nwho—speaking of that which is of the highest importance, but lies\nbeyond experience—decline to say on the one hand, “This can never be,”\nand on the other hand, “It must needs be precisely thus, and we know\nall about it.”",
