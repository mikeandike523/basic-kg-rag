Alas, a few years ago, I\nshould have said “my universe:” but now my mind has been opened to\nhigher views of things."

    "topic": "Title: \"Flatland: A Thought Experiment\"",
    "summary": "In Flatland, the inhabitants perceive nothing but straight lines due to the lack of light and shadows. They cannot distinguish between triangles, squares, and other figures. The penny appears as a circle when viewed from above, and becomes a straight line when viewed from the edge of the table. The same is true for triangles and squares. The inhabitants use the constant attraction to the South and the rain as compasses. In temperate regions, they may have difficulty determining their bearings.",
    "paragraphs": [
      "In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that\nthere should be anything of what you call a “solid” kind; but I dare\nsay you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the\nTriangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described\nthem. On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least\nso as to distinguish one figure from another. Nothing was visible, nor\ncould be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of\nthis I will speedily demonstrate.",
      "Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning\nover it, look down upon it. It will appear a circle.",
      "But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your\neye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the\ninhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and\nmore oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye\nexactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually\na Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,\nand will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.",
      "The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a\nTriangle, or a Square, or any other figure cut out from pasteboard. As\nsoon as you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will\nfind that it ceases to appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes\nin appearance a straight line. Take for example an equilateral\nTriangle—who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class.\nFigure 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were\nbending over him from above; figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman,\nas you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on\nthe level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the\ntable (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing\nbut a straight line.",
      "[Illustration]",
      "When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar\nexperiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant\nisland or coast lying on the horizon. The far-off land may have bays,\nforelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a\ndistance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright\nupon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light\nand shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.",
      "Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other\nacquaintances comes towards us in Flatland. As there is neither sun\nwith us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none\nof the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland. If our friend\ncomes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it\nbecomes smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a\nTriangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will—a straight\nLine he looks and nothing else.",
      "You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantagous circumstances we are\nable to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to\nthis very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I\ncome to describe the inhabitants of Flatland. For the present let me\ndefer this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses\nin our country.",
      "§ 2 Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland",
      "As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass\nNorth, South, East, and West.",
      "There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us\nto determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our\nown. By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the\nSouth; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight—so that\neven a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs\nnorthward without much difficulty—yet the hampering effort of the\nsouthward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most\nparts of our earth. Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated\nintervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance;\nand in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course\nhave their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so\nthat the roofs may keep off the rain from the North. In the country,\nwhere there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some sort\nof guide. Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be\nexpected in determining our bearings.",
      "Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is\nhardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where\nthere have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been\noccasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting\ntill the rain came before continuing my journey. On the weak and aged,\nand especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much\nmore heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point\nof breeding, if you meet a Lady on the street, always to give her the\nNorth side of the way—by no means an easy thing to do always at short\nnotice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is\ndifficult to tell your North from your South."
